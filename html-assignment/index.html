            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Damira and I am 18 years old. I was born in the city of Bishkek which is the capital of Kyrgyzstan. I entered <em>Algonquin College</em> a year ago and now I am finally studying here as I dreamed of. I flew to Canada alone and miss my family a little, but I think I made the right decision. </p>
            <p>Studying abroad was not my only dream. I have also dreamed of becoming a professional dancer since childhood. I want to perform on a huge stage and show people incredible and exciting performances. Before, all my dreams seemed impossible to me, but as I grew up, I realized that such thoughts were stopping me.</p>
