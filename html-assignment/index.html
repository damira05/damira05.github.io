            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Damira and I am 18 years old. I was born in the city of Bishkek which is the capital of Kyrgyzstan. I decided to apply to <em>Algonquin College</em> in 10<sup>th</sup> grade and now I am finally studying here as I dreamed of. I flew to Canada alone and miss my family a little, but I think I made the right decision. </p>
            <p>Studying abroad was not my only dream. When I started going to the <abbr title="Fam Dance">FD</abbr> dance studio in my country, I had a dream of becoming a professional dancer. This dream is still with me. I want to perform on a huge stage and show people incredible and exciting performances. Before, all my dreams seemed impossible to me, but as I grew up, I realized that such thoughts were stopping me.</p>
