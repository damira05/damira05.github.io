                <img id="enhypen" src="images/paragraphpic.webp" alt="Photo of group">
                    <p>ENHYPEN is a South Korean boy band formed by BE:LIFT Lab, a music label under HYBE corporation, through a survival competition show I-Land. The group consist of seven multinational members JUNGWON, HEESEUNG, JAY, JAKE, SUNGHOON, SUNOO, and NI-KI.

                    They officially debuted on November 30th, 2020 with the song “Given-Taken”.  ENHYPEN are known for their dynamic and highly synchronized performances, which have garnered them international praise as the “4th Generation Hot Icons” and “Global K-pop Rising Stars.”  They are the fastest K-pop boy group to become a million seller, and the first and only K-pop act in history to have all of their albums RIAJ certified.
                    
                    Their fandom name is ENGENE, which is derived from the words “engine” and “gene.”  ENGENES are the engines that help them “keep going” and the genes that share the same DNA as the group to “connect, discover, and grow together.”<a href="https://www.enhypenguide.com/enhypen" target="_blank">The author of the first paragraph</a></p>

                    <p>Enhypen will have their third world tour in 2024 and will visit North and South America. These are their first shows in Canada, so more cities were included in the tour.
                    Fans across Canada are diligently preparing to welcome the group to their cities, gathering places have been designated where fans meet and exchange various merchandise and photo cards.</p>
